Notes[^1]:

- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.
- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.
- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never "talk" to each other
- In an "encoder" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a "decoder" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.
- "self-attention" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In "cross-attention", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)
- "Scaled" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much. Illustration below
